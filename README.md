- Set up the necessary data models to represent geoJsons and users. ✅
- Properly handled errors, including sending appropriate error messages and status codes in response. ✅
- Implemented a map view where users can draw custom shapes on the map using a tool like Leaflet. ✅
- Users can save the drawn shapes to their account. ✅
- Added unctionality to edit existing shapes, including modifying their geometry and attributes. ✅
- Implemented server-side validation to ensure that geoJson data is valid before saving it to the database. geoJson must have a title and short description. ✅
- Create endpoints for uploading and managing GeoJSON. ✅
- Validation for user registration and login data. ✅
